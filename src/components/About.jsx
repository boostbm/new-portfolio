        Web Developer, B-Boy (Break Dancer), Jiu Jitsu Practitioner. After
        teaching English in South Korea for 11 years, I have returned back home
        with a new set of goals to live my life to the fullest. As a Web
        Developer, I strive to deliver cutting edge features through aesthetic
        and intuitive user interfaces. The ideas of continual growth and
        improvement excite me, whether that means constantly learning or even
        solving problems in different ways. I am always eager to tackle new
        challenges head on. Thereâ€™s nothing more satisfying than shipping a
        meaningful product that will transform and elevate the user experience.
